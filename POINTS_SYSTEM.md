# PlanWise Points System 🏆

## How Points Are Calculated

Points are awarded when you complete a task based on multiple factors to reward more challenging work.

---

## Formula

```
Total Points = (Base Points × Priority Multiplier) + Deep Work Bonus + Cognitive Load Bonus
```

---

## 1️⃣ Base Points (Duration)

**1 point per 10 minutes of estimated task duration**

Examples:
- 30 minute task = 3 base points
- 60 minute task = 6 base points
- 120 minute task = 12 base points

---

## 2️⃣ Priority Multipliers

Tasks with higher priority get bonus multipliers:

| Priority | Multiplier | Effect |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Low** | 1.0x | Base points (no bonus) |
| **Medium** | 1.5x | 50% bonus |
| **High** | 2.0x | 100% bonus (double) |
| **Urgent** | 3.0x | 200% bonus (triple) |

---

## 3️⃣ Deep Work Bonus

**+5 points** if the task is marked as "Deep Work" (requires high focus)

Deep work tasks demand uninterrupted concentration and deserve extra recognition!

---

## 4️⃣ Cognitive Load Bonus

**+3 points** if the task has cognitive load ≥ 8/10

High cognitive load tasks are mentally demanding and earn additional points.

---

## 📊 Examples

### Example 1: Simple Task
- **Duration**: 30 minutes → 3 base points
- **Priority**: Low → 1.0x multiplier
- **Deep Work**: No → +0 points
- **Cognitive Load**: 4/10 → +0 points
- **Total**: (3 × 1.0) + 0 + 0 = **3 points** ⭐

### Example 2: Important Study Session
- **Duration**: 60 minutes → 6 base points
- **Priority**: Medium → 1.5x multiplier
- **Deep Work**: Yes → +5 points
- **Cognitive Load**: 7/10 → +0 points
- **Total**: (6 × 1.5) + 5 + 0 = **14 points** ⭐⭐

### Example 3: Urgent Complex Project
- **Duration**: 120 minutes → 12 base points
- **Priority**: Urgent → 3.0x multiplier
- **Deep Work**: Yes → +5 points
- **Cognitive Load**: 9/10 → +3 points
- **Total**: (12 × 3.0) + 5 + 3 = **44 points** ⭐⭐⭐

### Example 4: High Priority Coding Task
- **Duration**: 90 minutes → 9 base points
- **Priority**: High → 2.0x multiplier
- **Deep Work**: Yes → +5 points
- **Cognitive Load**: 8/10 → +3 points
- **Total**: (9 × 2.0) + 5 + 3 = **26 points** ⭐⭐⭐

## 💡 Tips to Maximize Points

1. **Set Accurate Priorities**: Don't mark everything as urgent, but don't undersell difficult tasks either.

2. **Mark Deep Work Correctly**: If a task requires uninterrupted focus (studying, coding, writing), mark it as deep work.

3. **Assess Cognitive Load Honestly**: 
   - 1-3: Simple, routine tasks
   - 4-6: Moderate difficulty
   - 7-9: Challenging, requires mental effort
   - 10: Extremely difficult

4. **Break Large Tasks**: Instead of one 5-hour task, break it into smaller chunks. This gives you:
   - More frequent wins
   - Better point optimization
   - Clearer progress tracking

5. **Bundle Priorities**: Complete urgent tasks when you're at peak energy to maximize both productivity and points!

## 📈 Tracking Your Progress

View your total points on:
- **Dashboard**: Top card showing your current level and points
- **Profile**: Detailed stats with point history
- **Tasks Page**: See point value for each incomplete task

## 🎮 Gamification Philosophy

Points aren't just numbers - they represent **real work** and **real growth**:

✅ **Meaningful rewards** for challenging tasks
✅ **Fair recognition** for time invested
✅ **Motivation** to tackle difficult work
✅ **Honest system** - no gaming the numbers

Work smart, earn points, level up! 🚀
