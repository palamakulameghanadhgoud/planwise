## OPENING (20 seconds)

Good [morning/afternoon/evening]!

Picture this: It's 2 AM, you're drowning in assignments, your sleep schedule is destroyed, and you can't remember the last time you felt truly productive. If you're a student, you've lived this reality.

That's why we built **PlanWise** - an AI-powered productivity platform designed specifically for students who want to work smarter, not harder.

---

## THE PROBLEM (30 seconds)

Students today face four critical challenges:

1. **Information Overload** - Multiple courses, assignments, projects, extracurriculars. Traditional to-do lists can't handle it.

2. **Burnout** - Over 60% of college students report feeling overwhelmed by their workload.

3. **One-Size-Fits-All Apps** - Most productivity tools treat a 15-minute homework assignment the same as a 3-hour deep work session. But they're NOT the same.

4. **No Learning Loop** - We complete tasks but never understand our patterns. When are we most productive? How does sleep affect performance? Nobody tells us.

## THE SOLUTION (40 seconds)

**PlanWise** is your personal AI productivity coach that understands student life.

**Smart Task Management**: Not all tasks are equal . Tag tasks by priority (low to urgent), category (study, coding, fitness), cognitive load (1-10), and whether it requires deep work. Our AI schedules tasks during YOUR peak productivity hours.

**Sleep Tracking**: Log sleep hours, rate quality, track sleep debt. We correlate your sleep patterns with productivity - notice you crush it after 8 hours? The app reminds you.

**Skill Development**: Every task builds a skill. Coding assignments increase your programming hours. Fitness goals grow your health stats. Watch yourself level up from beginner to expert.

**Gamification That Matters**: Earn points, build streaks, unlock achievements tied to REAL accomplishments. "Sleep Champion" means 30 days of healthy sleep habits, not arbitrary badges.

---

## THE DASHBOARD (30 seconds)

Everything comes together in your personalized dashboard:
- Current streak and total points
- Sleep debt over the last week  
- Task completion rate
- Today's pending tasks
- AI-generated insights about YOUR productivity patterns

The dashboard learns from you. It might notice you're most productive Tuesday mornings, or that good sleep equals more completed tasks. It's like having a data scientist analyzing your productivity 24/7.

## TECHNOLOGY (20 seconds)

**Frontend**: React + Vite for lightning-fast performance
**Backend**: FastAPI - one of the fastest Python frameworks
**Database**: MongoDB for flexible, scalable storage
**Authentication**: Secure OAuth with Google, JWT tokens
**Security**: End-to-end encryption, enterprise-grade MongoDB Atlas

Your data is yours. We don't sell it, don't share it, and you can export or delete it anytime.

## REAL RESULTS (30 seconds)

Meet Meghanadh, CS student. Here's his Monday with PlanWise:

**8 AM**: "Complete Algorithm Assignment" scheduled during peak focus (high cognitive load, deep work)
**2 PM**: "Update Business Plan" - lighter task after lunch
**Evening**: Plans 7 AM workout for tomorrow (building fitness skill)
**Night**: Logs 7 hours sleep - app notes 1 hour sleep debt this week

**Result**: Task completion up 35%, sleep improved, Python skill leveled from 7 to 8.

## CLOSING (15 seconds)

Students are overwhelmed. Traditional tools don't understand student life. PlanWise combines AI, gamification, and wellness tracking with proven results.

**The question isn't whether students need better productivity tools.**

Thank you! Questions?

## Q&A - QUICK ANSWERS

**Q: How is this different from a to-do list?**
A: To-do lists are passive storage. PlanWise is active coaching - it learns, suggests, and provides insights.

**Q: Privacy concerns?**
A: All data encrypted, OAuth authentication, you own your data, no selling to third parties. Period.

**Q: Why only students?**
A: Students have unique challenges - irregular schedules, varying cognitive demands. By focusing on them, we solve their specific problems better than generic apps.

**Q: User acquisition?**
A: Campus ambassadors, student org partnerships, content marketing, and university wellness program integrations.

**Q: Competition?**
A: We're not competing - we're creating a new category. Student-focused productivity + wellness + AI insights doesn't exist yet.
